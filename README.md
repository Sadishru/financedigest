I'm Sadish. This simple project demonstrates a finance digest. For the user CRUD, there was only the first/last names so I used a component with a modal instead of a page in app router. 
I've used react-native-responsive-screen library to maintain responsiveness within different devices. Which is easier to use rather than Dimensions API.

I didn't use any external assets or animations (not even lottie), only the given figma design is implemented here. I've tested on both ios and android devices to ensure code quality. 



Kudos to whoever you are!! Thank you so much.
