## 🚀 About This Project

I'm **Sadish**. This project showcases a **Finance Digest** app built with React Native.
- User CRUD functionality is implemented with a **modal component** instead of a page in the App Router.
- **react-native-responsive-screen** is used for better responsiveness across devices, making it simpler than the Dimensions API.
- No external assets or animations (not even Lottie) were used—everything is based on the provided **Figma design**.
- Fully tested on **iOS and Android** to ensure code quality.

🎉 **Kudos to you for checking this out!** Thank you! 🙌
